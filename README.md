### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/anujvaghani0/college-project/tree/master/Assignment-2)
- Create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/anujvaghani0/college-project/tree/master/Assignment3)
-  Create an HTML file (e.g. first_page.html) that specifies a page that contains a heading and two paragraphs of text. Use the HTML tags ```<h1> ,</h1>, <p>, and </p>```, in this exercise. As the texts in the heading and paragraphs you can use any texts you like.
- Add an unordered list to your first web page. An unordered list should look like the following when it is shown by a browser:  An unordered list can be specified       with the tags ```<ul> and </ul>```.  An unordered list typically contains a number of list items that can be specified with tags ```<li> and </li>```.  After you have created  your unordered list, check out what happens when you convert it to an ordered list by replacing the tags ```<ul> and </ul> ```with ```<ol> and </ol>```, respectively. 
- Add an image to your web page. In this exercise you must use the ```<img> ```tag. As an image, you can use any .jpg or .png file you find on the Internet.
  Create another .html file that contains a heading and a couple of paragraphs. You could name this new file another_page.html, and you should place it into the same      folder where your first .html is. After you have created the new .html page, add a link to the first page so that the browser will load another_page.html when you    click the text Go to the other page. in the first page. 
- HTML tags like ```<a>``` can have certain attributes. The href attribute is mandatory in the <a> tag. Additionally it is possible to use the title attribute which specifies a text that emerges when the mouse cursor is moved above a link. This kind of text is called a tool tip. Modify the link that you created in the previous exercise so that a tool tip says "This leads you to another page." when the mouse cursor is over the link.
- It is possible to use a picture (image) as a link. Modify your page so that the picture that is on your page will also serve as a link that leads to another page.
